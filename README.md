# snowMapper ❄️🏔️🛰️🗺️ (...Coming soon!)

*A Python GEE package for mapping & reconstructing high-res daily snow cover.*

snowMapper is a physics-informed, machine learning-driven model, designed for reconstructing daily snow cover over mountainous areas. It is trained on in situ data, forced by gridded meteorological conditions, and assimilated with binary snow cover from high-resolution satellite imagery.
